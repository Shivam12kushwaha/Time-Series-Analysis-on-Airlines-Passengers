This project involves analyzing historical data on airline passenger counts to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns. Using datasets such as the classic "Air Passengers" series, which spans from 1949 to 1960, the project applies various time series analysis techniques to understand long-term trends and seasonal fluctuations. Key methods include data cleaning, stationarity testing, and modeling using ARIMA or SARIMA models to forecast future passenger numbers. The goal is to provide insights into historical trends and predict future passenger counts, aiding decision-making in the aviation industry.
